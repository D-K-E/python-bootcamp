# Y(et) A(nother) (Introduction) to P(rogramming) with (Functional) P(ython)

As the title states quite explicitely this is just another introduction to
programming. The language of choice is Python 3.
Our paradigm of choice is functional paradigm. I believe that composing
functions is an easier concept to grasp, and reproduce. This choice is
certainly biased, relative, etc. 
If you insist on learning programming from an object oriented perspective,
there are a lot of other tutorials/books available online. However you might
still want to checkout first few sections, since first steps and general
building blocks for programs are same for all paradigms anyway
